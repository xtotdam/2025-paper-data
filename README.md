Research data for "Formation of the H3CS-Au-SCH3 complex on Au(111): a molecular dynamics study" manuscript by Andrey L. Klavsyuk; Alexey G. Syromyatnikov; Ivan Y. Yakhin; Alexander M. Saletsky

## Files description

* `AuSCH_2013.ff` This file contains the force field parameters for the ReaxFF potential used in the calculations, sourced from ([Bae et al. (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1021/jp405992m))
* `neb/` This directory contains the initial and final atomic configurations for the Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) calculations discussed in the manuscript. These configurations were obtained from the work of ([Duijnstee et al. (2025)](https://doi.org/10.1039/D4CP03709J))
* `parts/` This directory contains structural components used to construct more complex atomic configurations.
